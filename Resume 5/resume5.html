<h5>Job 1</h5>

<p> My first job out of university as an analytical chemist doing GC-FID and the occasional bit of LCMS.

Personally, I have learned a lot on the technical side when compared to what I learned in my degree (MChem). I was eager to take all the knowledge and put it into practice. I made a couple of mistakes, but I have leant so muc from my superiors. The support I received from the team was amazing. They allowed me to learn and groomed me. My first job was a learning curve and the experience and support I received was one of the best. </p>


<h6>Job 2</h6>

<p> My second job was a breeze. I was confident in what I was doing, understood the process completely. My passion landed me a promotion to a senior position, from there I knew nothing was impossible for me.I continued to work hard. </p>
