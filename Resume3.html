                <h5>Job 1</h5>

                <p> My first job out of university as an analytical chemist doing GC-FID and the occasional bit of LCMS.

                    Personally, I have learned a lot on the technical side when compared to what I learned in my degree
                    (MChem). I was eager to take all the knowledge and put it into practice. I made a couple of
                    mistakes, but I have leant so muc from my superiors. The support I received from the team was
                    amazing. They allowed me to learn and groomed me. My first job was a learning curve and the
                    experience and support I received was one of the best. </p>

                <h6>Job 2</h6>

                <p> My second job was a breeze. I was confident in what I was doing, understood the process completely.
                    My passion landed me a promotion to a senior position, from there I knew nothing was impossible for
                    me.I continued to work hard. </p>
